# Audion
# ðŸ”Š Audio Intelligence Platform

A web-based tool for analyzing and comparing audio recordings, built with **React (frontend)** and **Python (backend)**. The platform allows users to upload multiple audio files, compare unknown sounds to a known database, generate visual feedback like spectrograms, and run various audio-processing tasks â€“ all from a clean, browser-based interface.

## âœ¨ Features

- Upload and compare multiple audio files
- Automatic sound matching using machine learning
- Visualize audio signals (e.g., spectrograms, waveform)
- Modular architecture for future audio tools:
  - Speaker identification
  - Speech-to-text
  - Sound event detection
  - Noise filtering and preprocessing
- User-friendly UI with modern React and routing
- FastAPI backend for real-time audio processing
